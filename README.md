# AI Traffic Optimizer

An AI-powered system for predicting traffic congestion, estimating travel times, and calculating carbon emissions.

## Features
- **Traffic Prediction**: Classifies traffic as "Light Traffic" or "Heavy Traffic".
- **Travel Time Estimation**: Calculates approximate travel time.
- **Carbon Emissions Calculation**: Estimates real-time carbon emissions based on traffic data.

## How to Run

1. **Backend**:
    - Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Start the server:
      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```

2. **Frontend**:
    - Open `frontend/src/index.html` in your browser.

3. **Models**:
    - Use `train_model.py` to train and save the machine learning model.

## Future Enhancements
- Dynamic route optimization.
- Integration with live traffic data APIs.
- Enhanced carbon emission calculations.
